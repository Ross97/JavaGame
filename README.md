## What is this?
Finder is a simple 2D game written in Java where the aim is to collect (find) items strewn throughout the world. The player can interact with the world in different ways, for example chopping down tress to collect wood, or fighting enemies to collect gold. It is a simple game of exploration. Combat is not necessary as the player can always just run away!

## Technologies
This game was written exclusively in Java (using Eclipse), however the asset creation was done in GIMP. The game is made up of over 30 classes spread across many packages. The game makes use of inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes. The world is loaded from a .txt file (reads in where to spawn the player, and what tiles to place where).
